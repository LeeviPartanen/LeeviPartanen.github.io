    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>On this page I present mostly programming-related projects that I have done during my studies. Unfortunately all these examples are in Finnish.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>C#</h2>
    <img src="/images/tekstiseikkailupeli.PNG" alt="Text adventure game">
    <p>Above you can see a snippet of code. The code becomes a text adventure game. The player follows the story as text. The player must make choices that affect the course of the game.
        The game can only be won by making the right choices.</p>

    <p>Here's another picture of what the gameplay looks like.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="/images/arvauspeli.PNG" alt="Guessing game">
    <p>Here's a different code snippet. So it is a guessing game that draws a random integer and asks the user to guess it.
        The program tells whether the number is lower or higher than the user's guess. The program finally shows how many seconds it took the user to guess
        correct number.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
    <img src="/images/vuokraovi.PNG" alt="Rental apartment search form">
    <p>Here is a picture of a task where you had to create a search form for a rental apartment in the same style as on the Vuokraovi.com page. First, the necessary elements were added
        using HTML and then given style specifications such as color and layout with CSS.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="/images/tiikerit.PNG" alt="Tigers">
    <p>In this task, a finished text about tigers and an example picture of what the finished page should look like were given. Then it had to be added to the website
        style definitions and make the page look as similar as possible to the example.</p>
